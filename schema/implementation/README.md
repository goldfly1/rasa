## Separation of Concerns

The **Architecture Schema** (`architectural_schema_v2.1.md`) defines the **what** and **who talks to whom**. It is the boundary document ? components, contracts, entities, and interface failure modes. It should stay stable even if you swap from Redis to RabbitMQ, or from containers to VMs.

This **Implementation Schema** defines the **how**, per component. It covers internal state machines, tech stack choices, deployment topology, performance budgets, and operational runbooks. This layer changes as you iterate.

### Why two documents?
- **Different audiences.** Architects read the boundary doc. Engineers read the component internals.
- **Different volatility.** The architecture should not churn because you decided to use Postgres instead of Neo4j for the graph store.
- **Different lifecycle.** Architecture is reviewed for correctness against strategy. Implementation is reviewed for feasibility against constraints.

### Organic link between them
- Architecture references implementation decisions as `{see impl: <component>}`.
- Implementation docs open with a link back to their architectural boundary and a statement: *This document implements the interface contract defined in `architectural_schema_v2.1.md` ?X.Y*.
- When architecture changes, implementation docs update. When implementation discovers a boundary problem, architecture docs get a revision.

## Document Template

Every component implementation doc should use this structure:

```markdown
# <Component Name>

> **Architectural Reference:** `architectural_schema_v2.1.md` ?X.Y  
> **Status:** Draft / In Review / Stable  
> **Owner:** TBD

## 1. Purpose
One-paragraph summary of what this component does.

## 2. Internal Design
(If this component is stateful, use `### 2.1 Internal State Machine`.)

### 2.1 Internal State Machine
(If applicable.) States, transitions, triggers.

## 3. Tech Stack Choices
Database, language, framework, and rationale.

## 4. Deployment Topology
Process model, replication, co-location with other components.

## 5. Operational Concerns
Health checks, metrics exposed, alert thresholds, runbook links.

## 6. Open Questions
Known gaps or decisions to make.

## 7. Change Log
| Date | Change | Author |
|------|--------|--------|
```

---

## Continuous Validation
A lightweight linter should enforce:
- Every component doc links back to a valid architectural ? in `architectural_schema_v2.1.md`.
- The directory structure table in this README matches actual files in the folder.
- Status fields use the allowed set: `Draft / In Review / Stable / Deprecated`.
